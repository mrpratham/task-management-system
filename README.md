# TASK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
A task management system built using JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB provides a robust solution for organizing, tracking, and prioritizing tasks within projects or workflows. Here's a brief description of how such a system might function:

Frontend: The front end of the task management system would likely be built using JavaScript frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue.js. It would allow users to interact with the system, create new tasks, update existing ones, assign tasks to individuals or teams, set deadlines, add descriptions, and mark tasks as completed.

Backend (Node.js): Node.js would power the backend of the task management system. It handles requests from the front end, processes data, interacts with the database and sends responses back to the client. Using Node.js allows for efficient handling of asynchronous operations and scalability.

Database (MongoDB): MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is well-suited for storing flexible data structures like tasks and their associated metadata. It allows for easy scalability, high availability, and flexible schema design. MongoDB's document-oriented model makes it straightforward to store tasks along with their attributes such as title, description, due date, status, priority, and assigned user.

Key Features:

1. User Authentication and Authorization: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their tasks. Authentication ensures that only authorized users can access and modify tasks.

2. Task Creation and Management: Users can create new tasks, assign them to individuals or teams, set due dates, mark priority levels, add descriptions, and attach files or links.

3. Task Filtering and Sorting: Users can filter tasks based on criteria such as status, due date, priority, or assigned user. Sorting options allow users to organize tasks according to their preferences.

4. Real-Time Updates: Utilizing technologies like WebSockets or server-sent events, the system can provide real-time updates to users, such as when a task is assigned to them or when a task's status changes.
